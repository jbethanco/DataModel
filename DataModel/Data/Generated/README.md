#  What are these files?

These are the NSManagedObject subclasses for Entities within the data model.

These files are unmodified and generated by selecting the data model and then selecting:
Editor > Create NSManagedObjectSubclass and selecting all, some, or none of the entities. 
These are similar to the ones autogenerated by Xcode when you select to do automatic code gen 
when editing an entity. If you update the Data Model entities, delete all these files and generate again.

#  Why are these files here?

With the automatically generated files, Xcode will often present false errors showing Entitie Classes do not exist. 
To prevent that, we manually generate these, and leave them here, unchanged.
